# Language

Words matter. Use language to support each other.

How I'm doing this is by working a lot of common terminology out of the words I use every day. 

## Why change my language?

I'm not alone. TTS, where I work, created [inclusion bot](https://18f.gsa.gov/2022/11/14/improving-inclusion-continuously-how-we-iterated-on-our-bot-to-promote-more-inclusive-and-thoughtful-language/) to nudge people in Slack about the words they use. I've [contributed to inclusion bot over time](https://github.com/18F/charlie/blob/main/src/scripts/inclusion-bot.yaml) and also [spoken about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xwC2q8G4J8). 

I also recommend [Intuit content design's Anti-racist language](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/accessibility-and-inclusion/anti-racist-language/), which includes [a list of specific words to avoid](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/accessibility-and-inclusion/anti-racist-language/#specific-word-guidance)

## Index and intro

I'll be creating a list of my own here shortly. Right now I keep this as a private ever-expanding list, but folks have asked me if I could share it, so hello! that's forthcoming. The major categories right now are: ableist, addiction / alcohol / substance use, animal use / abuse, capitalist, carceral, classist, closed practices / appropriation / diminutizing, colonial (common crossover with racist), colorism, competitive (also sometimes ableist), gambling (not great for some people for religious or addiction reasons), gendered, illegal, military (very long due to crossover in government), mocking other languages / English as a second language, racial overtones / slavery (frequent crossover with racist), racist / eugenicist, religious (many majority religions have acted oppressively), sexual / sexual violence, violent (frequent crossover with military). 

A couple categories I keep privately but don't intend to put here include sports, since competition sometimes gets ugly, they're often Americanisms, especially baseball references, and also I'm often just not good at these, swearing, some that just sound bad, and a miscellaneous / catch-all category mostly consisting of edge cases.

## Alternatives

What language could we use that's better? is a longer-term project. My colleague Peter suggested theatre kid terminology like "hard act to follow," for example.
