Words matter. Use language to support each other.

How I'm doing this is by working a lot of common terminology out of the words I use every day. 

I'm not alone. TTS, where I work, created [inclusion bot](https://18f.gsa.gov/2022/11/14/improving-inclusion-continuously-how-we-iterated-on-our-bot-to-promote-more-inclusive-and-thoughtful-language/) to nudge people in Slack about the words they use. I've [contributed to this over time](https://github.com/18F/charlie/blob/main/src/scripts/inclusion-bot.yaml) and also [spoken about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xwC2q8G4J8). 

What I've read here I recommend: [Intuit content design's Anti-racist language](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/accessibility-and-inclusion/anti-racist-language/), which includes [a list of specific words to avoid](https://contentdesign.intuit.com/accessibility-and-inclusion/anti-racist-language/#specific-word-guidance)

I'll be creating a list of my own here shortly. Right now I keep this as a private ever-expanding list, but folks have asked me if I could share it, so hello! that's forthcoming
