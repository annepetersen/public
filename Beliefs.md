# My beliefs

## On Collectivity
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others
- Gay marriage should be legal everywhere
- Abortion should be legal everywhere
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere
- Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment
- Owning a gun should require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years

## On Life
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life
- We don't have a purpose given to us, but we can make one up

## On Science & The Universe
- Other dimensions and universes exist
- Micro and macro evolution happens
- Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again
- Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe
- We have no cosmic significance
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist

## On Health
- We can change our behavior and habits (it requires a lot of energy)
- Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society

## On Technology
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)

## On The Self
- We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
- Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats
- People, organizations, and governments will exchange privacy for connection when they trust each other

## On Logic
- Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
- Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

## On The Future Of Earth (2100)
- Global warming is real and will continue to cause big problems
- The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
- Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
- Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil 

## On Biases
- We tend to favor the beautiful
- We tend to see what we expect to see

## Meta
- We have very little control over what we believe in
- Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
- Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
